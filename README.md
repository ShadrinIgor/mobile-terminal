## Basic dependencies
- @angular-redux/store
- bootstrap
- angular2-toaster
- angular2-ladda

## Tasty moments
- Change changeDetect strategy for optimization
- Use redux for save history of payments
- Use i18n for saving the text information about errors
- Use zone.runOutsideAngular for optimization (Suppose this operation is very expensive and we do not need to render the component until we finish)
